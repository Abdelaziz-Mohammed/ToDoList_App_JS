# ToDoList_App_JS
HTML, CSS, and JS ToDoList_App_JS at my learning journey. The second project from 30_Days_With_30_Projects learning journey.

## To-Do List App
This project is a To-Do List Application that allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. It uses `localStorage` to save the list of tasks, so the data persists even when the browser is closed or refreshed.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
- Remove tasks by clicking the cross (×) button.
- Save the list of tasks using `localStorage` for persistence.
- Input validation to avoid empty tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the main structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For managing user interactions, DOM manipulation, and data persistence using `localStorage`.

## How to Use
1. Enter a task in the input box.
2. Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed (strikethrough text).
4. Click the cross (×) button next to a task to delete it from the list.
5. The app automatically saves your tasks in `localStorage`, so your tasks will be available even after refreshing or closing the page.
